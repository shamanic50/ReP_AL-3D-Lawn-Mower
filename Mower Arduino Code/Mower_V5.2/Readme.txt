ReP_AL 3D Printed Robot Lawn Mower
----------------------------------

Code V5.2    - BETA (untested)
------------------------------

Upload the MEGA code to the Arduino MEGA
Upload the Nano code to the Arduino Nano


Features of 5.2
---------------

- Compass tracking with heading lock feature.   
           (switch on = 1 / off = 0 in the settings.   Set Power correction factor at CPower in settings)
- Set time variable to make setting the clock easier   
           (in settings switch set_Time = 1 to set the clock then back to 0 after setting it)
- Reverse motors variable to swap the motors inputs     
           (instead of having to swap wires on the motor bridge 0 = normal operation 1 = swapped)
- Code variables optimised to save space.
- Improved Serial communication between the NANO and the MEGA.
